					<p>I recently relocated to Santa Clarita, CA. Therefore, I am actively seeking a position in the technology industry, especially one that involves education. <br>
						My personal mission is to blend my industry knowledge of computer engineering with elementary education. 
						We live in an ever developing high-tech world where our youth are regularly surpassing their predecessors. 
						All too often, teachers running technology programs are only specific to one side, either technology or education. 
						This imbalance can lead to stunted learning if a child already knows the basics, or struggles to follow instruction, 
						which is where I find my passion. Bringing a comprehension that can cater to different levels; instruction for beginners, 
						as well as challenging improvement for the more advanced. I want to help guide these young people with my specialized understanding of the field, 
						to help cultivate future minds and encourage enthusiasm in STEM. <br>
						
						With this in mind, I have pursued experiences in both computing and education. I have work experience in computer software, and networking, in addition to experiences in hardware and embedded work through my schooling. Outside of my technical skills, I have training and awareness in the education and social justice domain. While pursing my technical degree I taught in various capacities as an after school mentor, summer school teacher, diversity training facilitator, and leadership instructor. Then as a full-time young working professional I continued to engage in my passion by volunteering to teach Cryptography at the Daughters and Sons day, and co-directing the Girls Who Code collaboration between IBM Massachusetts and local public libray. */
