					<p class="properParagraph">Kearstin Gauthier is a multifacted Computer Engineer who is actively seeking expeirences in the technology industry, specifically the technology education space and/or within the Women in technology movement.
					She grew up in Maine where there was a state wide initiative to put personal technology (i.e. tablets or laptops) in the hands of all students middle school aged and older. Being fournate enough to be exposed to
					technology at a young age she bacame intriged by it. So intrigued that she pursued a high school internship at a local Computer Networking facilited, and went on to earn a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering in Boston, Massachusetts. 
					Again, being fornate enough to recieve a degree in a STEM field, she saw the impact that technology can make on an indviduals socioeconomic status and overall living conditions. 
					With this in mind, out of college she purpused opportunities that not only strenghtened her technical skills, but strengthened others as well. The first year after recieving her undergraduate degree she worked at IBM as
					a Software Engineer on a cloud e-commerce product. Then, for personal reasons, she relocated to Santa Clarita, CA, where she is currently looking for employment and mentorship. <br>
