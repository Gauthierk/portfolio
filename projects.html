						<h3 style="text-align:center">IBM TJ Bot: Accessible AI</h3>
						<p class="properParagraph">While at IBM I worked on two supplementary projects that included IBM's open source TJ Bot project. Named after Thomas Watson Sr.,
						a beloved IBM CEO, the project aims to democratize technology, specifically knowledge of artificial intelligence. 
						TJ Bot, in plain terms, is a laser cut, or 3D printed robot designed around a Raspberry Pi. The Pi is programmed to call upon IBM's artificial intelligence (Watson) through APIs. <br>
						</p><p class="properParagraph">My first experience with TJ Bot consisted of working in a group of developers to create a "Study Bot." The Study Bot utilized Watson text-to-speech 
						and speech-to-text APIs to interface with a popular online study website (Quizlet). The final product had a user verbally interacting with TJ Bot whose knowledge was being pulled from website. 
						The project concept being inspired by the popular flashcard study technique that is more enjoyable and challenging when someone else is "quizing" you, but 
						not always having someone else to do so.
						</p><p class="properParagraph">My second experience with TJ Bot was while working as the Co-Director of the Girls Who Code IBM and Littleton Public Library Collaboration. In this instance myself and a few other instructors 
						mentored two teenaged girls who created their own TJ Bot project. The girls designed, and implemented a "Riddle Bot" that would serve a user a riddle and tell the user if they came up with the 
						correct solution. The Riddle Bot also had the capability of suggesting other actions a user could take (e.g. retrive a harder puzzle).
						</p><p class="properParagraph">I am currently waiting on permission to publish the projects code, but this work will hopefully be in my GitHub soon.
